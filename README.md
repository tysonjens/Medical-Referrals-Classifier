## Referrals Approval Classifier

A medical provider group reviews and approves or denies over 2 million referrals each year. It is costly to review each referral, so the group "auto-approves" 30% of all referrals from certain specialties when specific care is requested. There is appetite to increase the auto-approval rate to 40-50%, but approving a referral that should be denied is costly.

**Question:** Can a predictive model increase the auto-approval rate while keeping 'false positives' low?
